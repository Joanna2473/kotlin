/**
 * Represents KLib ABI dump and allows manipulating it.
 *
 * Usual [KlibDump] workflows consists of loading, updating and writing a dump back.
 *
 * **Creating a textual dump from a klib**
 * ```kotlin
 * val dump = abiTools.legacy.parseKlib(File("/path/to/library.klib"))
 * dump.printToFile(File("/path/to/dump.klib.api"))
 * ```
 *
 * **Loading a dump**
 * ```kotlin
 * val dump = abiTools.legacy.parseKlibDump(File("/path/to/dump.klib.api"))
 * ```
 *
 * **Merging multiple dumps into a new merged dump**
 * ```kotlin
 * val klibs = listOf(File("/path/to/library-linuxX64.klib"), File("/path/to/library-linuxArm64.klib"), ...)
 * val mergedDump = abiTools.legacy.emptyKlibDump()
 * klibs.forEach { mergedDump.merge(abiTools.legacy.parseKlib(it)) }
 * mergedDump.printToFile(File("/path/to/merged.klib.api"))
 * ```
 *
 * **Updating an existing merged dump**
 * ```kotlin
 * val mergedDump = abiTools.legacy.parseKlibDump(File("/path/to/merged.klib.api"))
 * val newTargetDump = abiTools.legacy.parseKlib(File("/path/to/library-linuxX64.klib"))
 * mergedDump.replace(newTargetDump)
 * mergedDump.printToFile(File("/path/to/merged.klib.api"))
 * ```
